Hi! Welcome to my page. Iâ€™m **Marcus**, a software engineer from Singapore, currently working at Thoughtworks Singapore. I build backend applications, manage cloud infrastructure, and maintain CI/CD pipelines. I also write the occasional bash script to automate tedious tasks and improve workflow efficiency. My path into tech wasnâ€™t straightforward. I hold a bachelor's degree in Business Management from Singapore Management University (SMU), where I first picked up programming out of curiosity in my sophomore year. Fascinated by its potential, I quickly became hooked. After graduating, I started my career in finance as a valuation associate before making the leap into tech, beginning with a role at DBS - and the rest is history.

The following are what I work with mostly:
