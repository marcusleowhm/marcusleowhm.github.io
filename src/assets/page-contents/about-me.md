Hi! And welcome to my page. My name is Marcus, and I am a software engineer from Singapore. I currently work in Thoughtworks Singapore, building backend applications, maintaining infrastructure on the cloud, and maintaining CI/CD pipelines. I occasionally do some bash scripting as well to improve productivity by automating the more mundane and repetitive tasks at work. Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
